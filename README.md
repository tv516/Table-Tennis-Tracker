Integrated stereo camera system with Snickerdoodle FPGA to capture court and ball data, filtering raw video to identify April Tags and compute X, Y, Z coordinates; streamed processed results to a Linux-based service and web GUI for real-time 3D visualization, enabling precise ball location tracking and in/out-of-bounds determination

My responsibilities included optimizing a Python algorithm to interface with an FPGA over TCP, managing agile sprint updates, and designing the systemâ€™s high-level architecture.
